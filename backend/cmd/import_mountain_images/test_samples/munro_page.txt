'''A' Mhaighdean''' is one of the least accessible of the [[munro]]s in northern [[Scotland]]. It is {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of [[Kinlochewe]] but most easily accessible from [[Poolewe]], taking a private road South East (pedestrian & bicycle access only) to Kernsary. A good track then leads to the causeway between the [[Fionn Loch]] and [[Dubh Loch, Gairloch|Dubh Loch]]. Follow the path eastwards to about the {{convert|1000|ft|m}} level and cross the Allt Bruthach an Esain to gain the North West ridge of the mountain.

The mountain is composed of [[gneiss]], the summit presenting the highest elevation of the [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian]]. Part of the North West ridge is capped by [[Torridonian]] [[sandstone]].
