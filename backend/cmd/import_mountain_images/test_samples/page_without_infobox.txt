The best known Munro is [[Ben Nevis]] (Beinn Nibheis), the highest mountain in the [[British Isles]] at 4,411&amp;nbsp;ft (1,345 m).

Munros are named after [[Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet]] (1856–1919), who produced the first list of such hills, known as ''Munro's Tables'', in 1891. Also included were what Munro considered lesser peaks, now known as '''Munro Tops''', which are also over 3,000 feet but are lower than the nearby primary mountain. The publication of the original list is usually considered to be the [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch event]] of modern [[peak bagging]].&lt;ref&gt;Lew, Alan A. and Han, Guosheng (2015).

== History ==
[[File:Sir Hugh Munro (Scotland).jpg|thumb|[[Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet]], creator of ''Munro's Tables'']]

Before the publication of ''Munro's Tables'' in 1891, there was much uncertainty about the number of Scottish peaks over 3,000 feet. Estimates ranged from 31 (in M.J.B. Baddeley's guides) to 236 (listed in Robert Hall's third edition of ''The Highland Sportsman and Tourist'', published in 1884). When the Scottish Mountaineering Club was formed in 1889, one of its aims was to remedy this by accurately documenting all of Scotland's mountains over 3,000 feet. [[Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet|Sir Hugh Munro]], a founding member of the club, took on the task using his own experience as a mountaineer, as well as detailed study of the [[Ordnance Survey]] six-inch-to-the-mile (1:10,560) and one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360) maps.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet (ed.), ''The Munros: Scottish Mountaineering Club Hillwalkers' Guide'', p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Scottish Mountaineering Club|url=http://www.smc.org.uk/AboutUs.php|publisher=The Scottish Mountaineering Club|access-date=6 September 2009|archive-date=4 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704113147/http://www.smc.org.uk/AboutUs.php|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munro researched and produced a set of tables that were published in the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] Journal in September 1891. The tables listed 538 summits over 3,000 feet, 282 of which were regarded as "separate mountains". The term ''Munro'' applies to separate mountains, while the lesser summits are known as ''Munro Tops''. Munro did not set any measure of [[topographic prominence]] by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain, so there has been much debate about how distinct two hills must be if they are to be counted as two separate Munros.

The Scottish Mountaineering Club has revised the tables, both in response to new height data on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps and to address the perceived inconsistency as to which peaks qualify for Munro status. In 1992, the publication of Alan Dawson's book ''Relative Hills of Britain'', showed that three Munro Tops not already considered summits, had a prominence of more than {{convert|500|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Relative Hills of Britain (1992 book) |url=https://www.rhb.org.uk/marilyns/rhb199200.htm |access-date=2024-07-05 |website=www.rhb.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this they would have qualified as [[Corbett (hill)|Corbett]] summits had they been under 3,000 feet. In the 1997 tables these three Munro Tops, on [[Beinn Alligin]], [[Beinn Eighe]] and [[Buachaille Etive Beag]], gained full Munro summit status. Dawson's book also highlighted a number of significant Munro Tops with as much as {{convert|60|m|ft|0|order=flip}} of prominence which were not listed as Munro Tops. The 1997 tables promoted five of these to full Munro status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idnEOw_Ml8IC&amp;pg=PR8|title=Munro Almanac|last=McNeish|first=Cameron|date=2011-12-14|publisher=Neil Wilson Publishing|isbn=9781906476946|pages=VIII of 'Introduction'|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 197 Munros have a [[topographic prominence]] of over {{convert|150|m|0|abbr=on}} and are regarded by [[Peakbagging|peakbaggers]] as Real Munros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=-926010| title=Real Munros| publisher=Peakbaggers| access-date=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 130 Scottish mountains over 1000m, with a [[topographic prominence]] of over {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}} have been termed Metric Munros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=-926548| title=Metric Munros| publisher=Peakbaggers| access-date=9 January 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109181452/https://www.peakbagger.com/list.aspx?lid=-926548| archive-date=9 January 2018| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classification schemes in Scotland, such as the Corbetts {{convert|2500|to(-)|3000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Graham (hill)|Grahams]] {{convert|2000|to(-)|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, require a peak to have a prominence of at least {{convert|500|ft|m|0}} for inclusion. The Munros, however, lack a rigid set of criteria for inclusion, with many summits of lesser prominence listed, principally because their summits are hard to reach.

Between April 2007 and July 2015 the [[Munro Society]] re-surveyed twenty mountains and tops that were known to be close to the 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft figure to determine their height more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Scaling the Heights: Measuring Scotland's Mountains |publisher=The Munro Society |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-9996293-0-4 |pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2009 the society announced that the mountain [[Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean]], south of [[Glen Carron]], had a height of {{convert|913.43|m|ftin|0|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?rf=900|title=Hill Bagging:Sgurr nan Ceannaichean |publisher=HillBagging |access-date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Scottish Mountaineering Club removed the Munro status of Sgùrr nan Ceannaichean and this mountain is now a [[Corbett (hill)|Corbett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMC confirm new Munro Table 10th Sept 09|url=http://www.smc.org.uk/Munros/Munros.php|date=10 September 2009|access-date=10 September 2009|publisher=The Scottish Mountaineering Club|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827193834/http://www.smc.org.uk/Munros/Munros.php|archive-date=27 August 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Summer 2011 height survey by The Munro Society, [[Beinn a' Chlaidheimh]] was found to be {{convert|914|m|ftin|0|order=flip}} and thus short of the Munro mark.

When compared to continental ranges, such as [[Alps|The Alps]], Scottish peaks are generally lesser in height. However, walking and climbing in them can still be dangerous and difficult to navigate the recommended routes due to their latitude and exposure to Atlantic and Arctic weather systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Mountains |url=https://cairngorms.co.uk/discover-explore/landscapes-scenery/the-mountains/ |access-date=2022-10-23 |website=Cairngorms National Park Authority |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sisley |first=Dominique |date=2018-10-24 |title=A survival guide to Munro bagging in the Scottish highlands |url=https://www.huckmag.com/outdoor/outdoors-adventure/survival-guide-munro-bagging-scotland-highlands/ |access-date=2022-10-23 |website=Huck Magazine |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in summer, the weather can change quickly in the mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Munro Bagging |url=https://360munros.co.uk/munro-bagging/ |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=360° Munros |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conditions can be atrocious; thunderstorms, thick fog, strong winds, driving rain and freezing summit temperatures close to 0°C are not unusual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-07-03 |title=Southwest Highlands |url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/mountain/southwest-highlands |access-date=2024-07-02 |website=Met Office |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of attempting to climb every Munro is known as "Munro bagging". Munro-bagging is a form of [[peak bagging]]. A walker who has climbed all Munros is entitled to be called a Munroist. Descending a Munro by funicular is known as de-bagging.

===Notable completions===
The [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] maintains a list of walkers who have reported completing the Munros. {{As of|2023|12|31}}, there are 7,654 names on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Compleators |url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/compleators |website=Scottish Mountaineering Club |access-date=9 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The club uses the spelling ''compleator'' for someone who has completed the Munros.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Scottish Mountaineering Club |url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/compleators |access-date=2024-01-23 |website=www.smc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Munro never completed his own list, missing out on [[Càrn an Fhidhleir]] and [[Càrn Cloich-mhuillin]] (downgraded to a Munro Top in 1981).&lt;ref name="Corrie"&gt;{{cite web| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709124842/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tac/tac44/indefenc.htm |archive-date=9 July 2011 |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tac/tac44/indefenc.htm |title=In defence of A E Robertson| author=Peter Drummond| publisher=The Angry Corrie| access-date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Hugh is said to have missed the Inaccessible Pinnacle of [[Sgùrr Dearg]], on the Isle of Skye, which he never climbed.&lt;ref name="test3"&gt;"The Munros" Page 5 Quote:"Sir Hugh himself never did manage the Inaccessible Pinnacle".&lt;/ref&gt; However the "In Pinn", as it is known colloquially within Scottish mountaineering, was only listed as a Munro Top on his list (despite being several metres higher than Sgùrr Dearg, which was listed as the main Munro Top).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Munros and Tops 1891–1997|url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html#munrotab|date=11 January 2008|access-date=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "completionist" was to be the Reverend [[A. E. Robertson]], in 1901, later minister at [[Braes of Rannoch]] from 1907.&lt;ref name="Corrie"/&gt; However, research has cast doubt on this claim, and it is not certain that he reached the summit of [[Ben Wyvis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Drummond| first=Peter|author2=Ian Mitchell| title=The First Munroist – the Reverend A E Robertson| publisher=Ernest Press| year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it is known that Robertson did not climb the Inaccessible Peak of Sgùrr Dearg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.walkingstories.com/original/innpinsummary.htm| title=Sgurr Dearg: The Inaccessible Pinnacle| publisher=Walking Stories| access-date=9 January 2018| archive-date=23 December 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223080556/http://www.walkingstories.com/original/innpinsummary.htm| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Robertson is discounted, the first Munroist is Ronald Burn, who completed in 1923. Burn is also (indisputably) the first person to climb all the Munro Tops.&lt;ref name="Corrie"/&gt;

The person with the most rounds of Munros is Steven Fallon from [[Edinburgh]], who has completed 16 rounds as of 1 October 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beinn Bhuidhe, Last Munro, 1 October 2019|url=https://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/blog/2019-10-01-beinn-bhuidhe.html|date=1 October 2019|access-date=30 July 2020|archive-date=3 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803144747/https://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/blog/2019-10-01-beinn-bhuidhe.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] became the first Member of Parliament to complete the Munros when he reached the summit of [[Sgurr nan Coireachan (Glenfinnan)|Sgùrr nan Coireachan]] on 27 May 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smc.org.uk/Munros/MunroistsCompleatists.php?ID=719 |title=Chris Smith, Scottish Mountaineering Club |access-date=23 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211204/http://www.smc.org.uk/Munros/MunroistsCompleatists.php?ID=719 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Fleetwood is probably the youngest person to have completed a round. He climbed the final Munro of his round – [[Ben More (Mull)|Ben More]] – on 30 August 2011 at the age of 10 years and 3 months.&lt;ref name=UKC&gt;Dan Bailey, [http://www.ukhillwalking.com/news/item.php?id=63851 "The Youngest Munro Completer"], ukclimbing.com, 2 September 2011. Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest completionist to have done the round without the presence of a parent or a guardian is probably Andy Nisbet, who finished his round in 1972 aged 18 years and 1 month.&lt;ref name=UKC/&gt;

====Continuous rounds====
[[Hamish Brown]] did the first continuous self-propelled round of the Munros (except for the Skye and Mull ferries) between 4 April and 24 July 1974 with {{convert|449000|ft|abbr=on}} of ascent and mostly walking {{convert|1639|mi|km|0|}} – just {{convert|150|mi|km|0}} were on a bicycle. The journey is fully documented in his book ''Hamish's Mountain Walk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Brown| first=Hamish M.| title=Hamish's Mountain Walk| publisher=Littlehampton Book Services| year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average time taken to bag all the Munros is eight years.&lt;ref name=ExcessB&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Fiona|url=http://www.carnethy.com/press_2008/rep_steven_herald/steven_herald_2008.htm|date=5 January 2008|access-date=25 January 2008|title=Excess Baggage|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 George Keeping accomplished the first continuous round of the Munros entirely on foot (and ferry) in 135 days. He went on to complete the English and Welsh 3,000 foot peaks in a further 29 days. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=DEMPSTER |first=ANDREW |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1287921905 |title=MURNOS a history. |date=2021 |publisher=LUATH PRESS LTD |isbn=978-1-910022-98-6 |location=[S.l.] |oclc=1287921905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reported completion of all the Munros plus the Munro Tops in one continuous expedition was by [[Chris Townsend (writer)|Chris Townsend]] in 1996. His trip lasted between 18 May and 12 September (118 days), he covered a distance of {{convert|1770|mi|km|0}} ({{convert|240|mi|km|0|disp=or}} by bicycle) with {{convert|575000|ft|abbr=on}} of ascent. The round was broken twice for spells at the office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Townsend| first=Chris| title=The Munros and Tops: A Record Setting Walk in the Scottish Highlands| publisher=Mainstream Publishing| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be regarded as stretching the meaning of "continuous".

The first person to complete a winter round (all the Munros in one winter season) was Martin Moran in 1984–85. His journey lasted between 21 December 1984 and 13 March 1985 (83 days), he walked {{convert|1028|mi|km|0}} with {{convert|412000|ft|abbr=on}} of ascent. He used motor transport ([[campervan]]) to link his walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Moran| first=Martin| title=The Munros in Winter: 277 summits in 83 days| publisher=David &amp; Charles| year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 2005–06, Steve Perry completed a continuous unsupported round entirely on foot (and ferry).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukhillwalking.com/articles/features/interview_steve_perrys_winter_munro_round-4400|title=Interview: Steve Perry's Winter Munro Round|website=ukhillwalking.com|date=9 February 2012 |language=en|access-date=2019-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the first person to have completed two continuous Munro rounds, having also walked Land's End to John O'Groats via every mainland 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft mountain between 18 February 2003 and 30 September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/news/article/mps/uan/3791 Steve Perry Completes Winter Munro Challenge, outdoorsmagic.com]{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fastest rounds====
In 1990, international fell runner and maths teacher Hugh Symonds of [[Sedbergh]], Yorkshire, ran all 277 Munros starting from [[Ben Hope]]. It took him 66 days and 22 hours. This also included running the other 3,000 foot peaks in Great Britain. Having achieved this in the short time of 83 days, when his target had been a hundred, he decided to add the [[Republic of Ireland]] tops to the list and still finished all 303 peaks in 97 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running High: The First Continuous Traverse of the 303 Mountains of Britain and Ireland|publisher=Fellrunner Magazine|url=http://www.hayloft.eu/running%20high.html|date=June 2004|access-date=2 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1992, Andrew Johnstone of [[Aberdeen]] and Rory Gibson of [[Edinburgh]] completed their mountain triathlon across the Munros, the 277 Scottish peaks over 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft, beating the existing record by five days. They began on 29 May and finished at 8.30pm on 15 July on the summit of Ben Hope, the most northerly Munro, completing a journey which began 51 days and 10 hours earlier on the [[Isle of Mull]]. After swimming lochs, cycling highland roads and running across some of the most desolate and dangerous terrain in Britain, they covered 1,400 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triathlon: Keeping faith on the road to Ben Hope: A triathlon peak has been scaled in the Highlands this week|first=Rob|last=Howard|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/triathlon-keeping-faith-on-the-road-to-ben-hope-a-triathlon-peak-has-been-scaled-in-the-highlands-1533440.html|date=15 July 1992|access-date=2 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlie Campbell, a former postman from [[Glasgow]], held the record for the fastest round of the Munros between 2000 and 2010. He completed his round in 48 days, 12 hours and 0 minutes, finishing on 16 July 2000, on [[Ben Hope]]. He cycled and swam between Munros; no motorised transport was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Finale|publisher=Munro Run 2000|url=http://www.munrorun2000.co.uk/finale.php|date=16 July 2000|access-date=2 September 2020|archive-date=6 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106101032/http://munrorun2000.co.uk/finale.php|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell's record was broken by Stephen Pyke of [[Stone, Staffordshire]], in 2010 who completed the round in 39 days, 9 hours and 6 minutes. Pyke's round started on the Isle of Mull on 25 April 2010 and finished on Ben Hope in Sutherland on 3 June 2010. He cycled and kayaked between Munros; no motorised transport was used. He was backed by a support team in a motor home, but had to camp out in the more remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's a marathon with a 10,000ft climb every day for five weeks – Munro record smashed|first=Jeremy|last=Watson|newspaper=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/scotland/It39s-a---marathon.6342775.jp|date=5 June 2010|access-date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2011, Alex Robinson and Tom O'Connell finished a self-propelled continuous round on Ben Hope in a time of 48 days, 6 hours and 56 minutes. At the age of just 21, Alex became the youngest person to have completed a continuous round without the use of any motorised transport.

On 17 September 2017, the women's self-propelled, continuous record was broken by Libby Kerr and Lisa Trollope in 76 days and 10 hours. This record would later be vastly broken by Jamie Aarons on 26 June 2023 who would also break the record for both the male and female fastest ever round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running Up Every 'Munro' Mountain in Scotland|first=Tim|last=Moss|publisher=The Next Challenge|url=https://thenextchallenge.org/running-every-munro-scotland/|date=1 February 2018|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2020, Pyke's record was broken by Donnie Campbell of [[Inverness]]. He completed his round in 31 days, 23 hours and 2 minutes, starting on the Isle of Mull on 1 August 2020 and finished on Ben Hope on 2 September 2020. Campbell ran the 282 Munros and cycled and kayaked between them. On day 29, he was joined by previous record holder Stephen Pyke. Whilst ticking off [[Mòruisg ]] in the cloud, he mistook the big cairn for the summit and had to head back up and so climbed the Munro twice. On day 31, he completed 18 Munros. He was supported by a crew travelling in his motorhome, who also shuttled his bike for him to follow a more linear route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donnie Campbell Breaks Munro Round Record|first=Nick|last=Brown|publisher=The Next Challenge|url=https://www.ukhillwalking.com/news/2020/09/donnie_campbell_breaks_munro_round_record-72468|date=2 September 2020|access-date=2 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Toughest' Munro-bagging record broken by a week|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-53999465|access-date=2 September 2020|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2023, Jamie Aarons of [[California]] broke the previous record of fastest ever round held by former marine Donnie Campbell by more than 12 hours by completing a self-propelled continuous round in 31 days, 10 hours and 27 minutes. She also ran, cycled and kayaked between each of the Munros, covering a total of around 932 miles (1,500 km) on foot and about the same distance by bike. She began at [[Ben More (Mull)|Ben More]] on [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and ended at [[Ben Klibreck]] in [[Sutherland]], raising £14,000 for [[World Bicycle Relief]].&lt;ref name=aarons&gt;{{cite news |title=Jamie Aarons: Woman sets record for scaling Scotland's Munro mountains |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66027099 |access-date=27 June 2023 |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furths==

The SMC recognises six peaks in England, fifteen in Wales and thirteen in Ireland that would be Munros or Munro Tops if they were in Scotland. These are referred to as [[Furth Munro]]s, i.e. the Munros furth of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bearhop | first=D.A. | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded Furthist is James Parker, who completed on [[Tryfan]] (Snowdonia) on 19 April 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Parker | first=James A. | year=1929 | title=Beinn Tarsuinn and the British 'Threes' | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal, XVIII, page 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
